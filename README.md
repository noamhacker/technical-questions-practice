A collection of practice questions I've worked on.

CTCI page 90 question 1.1:
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

CTCI page 90 question 1.2:
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other. [Code](http://ideone.com/xjYP6B) (better space-efficiency than CTCI solution!)
