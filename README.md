# technical-questions-practice
A collection of practice questions I've worked on.
<hr>
* CTCI page 90 question 1.1:
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/embed/jrtcab#)

* CTCI page 90 question 1.2: 
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/xjYP6B) (better space-efficiency than CTCI solution!)

* CTCI page 91 question 1.5:
Check if two strings are one edit or zero edits away (edit = insert, remove, or replace a character).
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/yUTcNY) (incomplete)

* to-do: CTCI page 91 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9

* CTCI page 94 question 2.1:
Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. Also try an O(1) space solution.
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/rmQ5Rn)

* CTCI page 95 question 2.7:
Given two singly linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect, and return the intersecting node (based on reference, not value).
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/KwJqfy)

* CTCI page 99 question 3.4:
Implement a Queue class which implements a queue using two stacks.
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/p2kyu3)

* CTCI page 109 question 4.2: Given a sorted increasing array, create a binary search tree with minimal height.
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/wekUzn)

* CTCI page 109 question 4.3: Given a binary tree, create a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (if the tree's depth is N, you must create N linked lists)
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/tYH7Mj), using HashMap instead of ArrayList

* CTCI page 110 question 4.5: Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/8oTq3U)
  
* CTCI page 116 question 5.3: You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from a 0 to a 1. Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of 1s you could create.
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/9Vujnx), worst case O(n^2) but can be improved to O(n) with some simple logic
