# technical-questions-practice
A collection of practice questions I've worked on.
<hr>
* CTCI page 90 question 1.1:
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/embed/jrtcab#)

* CTCI page 90 question 1.2: 
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/xjYP6B) (better space-efficiency than CTCI solution!)

* CTCI page 91 question 1.5:
Check if two strings are one edit or zero edits away (edit = insert, remove, or replace a character).
  * [Code](http://ideone.com/yUTcNY) (incorrect/incomplete)

* to-do: CTCI page 91 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9

* CTCI page 94 question 2.1:
Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. Also try an O(1) space solution.
